QA Engineer Jr
--------------

I come from an industrial background and I’m currently training as a QA Engineer at TripleTen, where I’m learning software quality assurance through manual testing and API testing. I work with tools like Postman, React and Jira to test applications and document bugs.

Before moving into tech, I worked as a quality analyst and project engineer, which gave me a strong mindset around processes, continuous improvement, and problem-solving. Now I’m transitioning into IT as a QA Tester, bringing fresh ideas, curiosity, and a strong desire to keep learning. I’m always happy to help, grow together as a team, and build better products. I truly believe in teamwork and continuous improvement in any environment.

# Urban Routes – QA Case Study

## Featured QA Project

🚖 **Urban Routes – QA Case Study**  
Hands-on QA project focused on functional testing, test case design, and bug reporting.

👉 **View the project here:**  
🔗 https://github.com/rodolfo389estrada-svg/urban-routes-qa-project


<details>
<summary><strong>📌 Project Overview</strong></summary>
  
<br>

This project represents my first hands-on experience in **Quality Assurance**, focused on functional testing and bug reporting for a ride-hailing application called **Urban Routes**.

Urban Routes is a private transportation application similar to Uber or DiDi, offering multiple transport options such as bicycles, taxis, motorcycles, standard cars, and luxury vehicles, as well as additional services.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧪 Testing Scope</strong></summary>

<br>

The main goal of this project was to validate the system behavior from the **end-user perspective**, focusing on:

- Address input fields ("From" and "To")
- Map behavior and route visualization
- Transport selection options
- UI interactions

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📝 Test Case Design</strong></summary>

<br>

I designed and executed **35 test cases**, each documented with:
- Test Case ID  
- Title  
- Preconditions  
- Step-by-step actions  
- Expected result  
- Test status (Passed / Omitted)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🐞 Bug Reporting</strong></summary>

<br>

When a test case failed, I created a structured bug report including:
- Bug ID  
- Clear and concise title  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected result  
- Actual result  
- Severity level (Low / Medium / High)

</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Key Learnings</strong></summary>

<br>

This project helped me develop strong foundations in:

- Functional analysis from the end-user perspective  
- Test case design and execution  
- Structured bug reporting and severity assessment  
- Attention to detail and critical thinking  
- Clear documentation and communication for QA processes  

</details>
