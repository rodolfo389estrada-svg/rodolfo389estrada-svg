QA Engineer Jr
--------------

I come from an industrial background and I’m currently training as a QA Engineer at TripleTen, where I’m learning software quality assurance through manual testing and API testing. I work with tools like Postman, React and Jira to test applications and document bugs.

Before moving into tech, I worked as a quality analyst and project engineer, which gave me a strong mindset around processes, continuous improvement, and problem-solving. Now I’m transitioning into IT as a QA Tester, bringing fresh ideas, curiosity, and a strong desire to keep learning. I’m always happy to help, grow together as a team, and build better products. I truly believe in teamwork and continuous improvement in any environment.

# Urban Routes – QA Case Study

## Featured QA Project

🚖 **Urban Routes – QA Case Study**  
Hands-on QA project focused on functional testing, test case design, and bug reporting.

🔗 https://github.com/rodolfo389estrada-svg/urban-routes-qa-project

## Project Overview
This project represents my first hands-on experience in **Quality Assurance**, focused on functional testing and bug reporting for a ride-hailing application called **Urban Routes**.

Urban Routes is a private transportation application similar to Uber or DiDi, offering multiple transport options such as bicycles, taxis, motorcycles, standard cars, and luxury vehicles, as well as additional services.

## Testing Scope
The main goal of this project was to validate the system behavior from the **end-user perspective**, focusing on:

- Address input fields ("From" and "To")
- Map behavior and route visualization
- Transport selection options
- UI interactions

## Test Case Design
I designed and executed **35 test cases**, each documented with:
- Test Case ID
- Title
- Preconditions
- Step-by-step actions
- Expected result
- Test status (Passed / Omitted)

## Bug Reporting
When a test case failed, I created a structured bug report including:
- Bug ID
- Clear and concise title
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Severity level (Low / Medium / High)

## Key Learnings
This project helped me develop strong foundations in:
- Functional analysis
- Test case creation and execution
- Bug documentation and severity assessment
- Attention to detail and critical thinking
